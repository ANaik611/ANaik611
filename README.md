## 📂 Featured Projects

Plant Disease Detection & Segmentation | YOLOv8, Python, OpenCV 
Engineered a YOLOv8-based pipeline for precise leaf disease segmentation in agricultural datasets. Applied semi-supervised learning to reduce 
annotation effort and improve generalization. Used thresholding and the shoelace algorithm for area computation and automated severity grading. 
Boosted detection accuracy from ~60% to 80% through iterative refinement 

Blood Bank Management System | React, CNN, TensorFlow, Leaflet API 
Created a full-stack web app to locate nearby blood banks and detect blood types from images using a CNN. Integrated Leaflet API for map 
visualization and improved accessibility. GitHub: Project Link [
